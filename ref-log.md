**Documented GenAI Usage:**

* **Code cleanup and organization:** After completing the main functionality, I used GenAI to refine the code’s structure — improving readability through consistent formatting, spacing, and clearer variable/function names. This made the code easier to maintain and understand for others.
* **Troubleshooting and debugging:** When facing errors or unexpected behavior, I used GenAI to interpret error messages and understand root causes. After drafting my own fix, I double-checked with GenAI to ensure that my solution wouldn’t create new issues or disrupt other parts of the program.

**External Tools and Resources Used:**

* **Technologies:** LangChain, ChromaDB, OpenAI API, Streamlit, PyPDF, Python Standard Library, GitHub Codespaces, and GenAI
* **References and Documentation:** Official documentation for LangChain, OpenAI API reference guides, and Chroma documentation

**UI Design Choices:**

* The interface uses a **dark, Halloween-themed design** with an atmospheric background image to enhance the visual appeal.
* Chat bubbles are styled in dark tones with contrasting accent borders to clearly distinguish user and assistant messages.
* The layout maintains a clean, modern look with rounded elements, consistent padding, and soft contrasts for better readability in low-light environments.
* This theme choice aligns with the season and gives the app a fun, immersive personality while keeping usability and accessibility in mind.
